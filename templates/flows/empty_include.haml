        Flows let you easily pose a set of questions to a group of users. When you send people through a flow over SMS,
        it is natural just like any other conversation.

        A flow gives you the power to model complex interactions by simply drawing a flowchart. With {{ brand }}'s drag-and-drop
        interface, you can easily build branches based on how people respond to your messages. This means it's easy to
        create highly personal and engaging experiences for your users.
