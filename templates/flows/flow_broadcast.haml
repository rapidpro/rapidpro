      To get started you need to add a channel to your account. A channel is a phone number or social network
      account which {{ name }} can use to send and receive messages on your behalf. You can choose to use an
      Android phone and your own cell phone plan, or we can connect you with a service provider in your country
      directly.

      To get started you need to add a USSD channel to your account. You can choose between USSD channels

        To get started you need to add a voice-enabled channel to your account. A voice-enabled channel is a
        phone number which {{ name }} can use to make and receive phone calls on your behalf. For example, Twilio
        is a service which provides voice-enabled numbers which you can add as channels in your {{ name }} account.
