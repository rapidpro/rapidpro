          Using a simple drag-and-drop interface, anybody can design a custom SMS application
          that is tailored to their needs. Design a flow in minutes and start getting responses
          instantly. Once people start interacting with your flow, use real-time analytics to
          see how things are going.

            No matter where you are in the world, it's easy to configure {{name}} to work on real phones without delay.
            Whether you want to use a Twilio number, a direct connection with your local carriers, or even the SIM card
            you already have, we've got you covered.

            You can also use our flow simulator if you don't want to setup a number right away.

      %p
        -blocktrans with name=brand.name
          Before you do anything else in {{name}}, it is helpful to have a list of contacts. This will make it easy to send a message or survey out
          to a wide distribution list.

          For example, you might have groups
          called <i>Field Staff</i>, <i>Office Managers</i>, or <i>Trainees</i>. You can import these groups into
          {{name}} by uploading an Excel file using our
          %a{href:'{{STATIC_URL}}/examples/contacts.xls'}
            template
          as a guide. We'll create a group for you automatically for each file you upload. Don't worry, it's easy to add or
          remove people from groups later if you need to tweak things.
      %p
        -blocktrans
          If you want anybody to be able to join a group using SMS, you can set a <i>join keyword</i>. Anybody who
          texts with that keyword will automatically be registered into the group.

          %a.btn.workflow-btn{href:"{% url 'contacts.contact_import' %}"}

            -trans "Create Contact"

      %p
        -blocktrans with name=brand.name
          If you use e-mail, reading and writing messages in {{name}} should already be familiar to you. Just like e-mail, you have an Inbox and it's easy to label
          messages so you can follow up with them later. {{name}} also allows you to schedule a message to be sent later or even as a reminder
          on a regular schedule.

      %p
        -blocktrans with name=brand.name
          For example you might have {{name}} send a message every Friday reminding people in the <i>Field Staff</i> group to complete their weekly report.
          If anybody joins the <i>Field Staff</i> group later, they will automatically start receiving the weekly reminder.

          {{name}} also offers a robust REST API to add SMS features to your own website. Have a look through the
          %a{href:'{{api_url}}'}
            API documentation
          to learn more.
