# [Video.js - HTML5 Video Player](http://videojs.com)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/videojs/video.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/videojs/video.js)

> Video.js is a web video player built from the ground up for an HTML5 world. It supports HTML5 and Flash video, as well as YouTube and Vimeo (through [plugins](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/wiki/Plugins)). It supports video playback on desktops and mobile devices. This project was started mid 2010, and the player is now used on over ~~50,000~~ ~~100,000~~ 200,000 websites.

## Quick start
Thanks to the awesome folks over at [Fastly](http://www.fastly.com/), there's a free, CDN hosted version of Video.js that anyone can use.
Also, check out the [Getting Started](http://videojs.com/getting-started/) page on our website which has the latest urls as well.
Simply add these includes to your document's
`<head>`:

```html
<link href="//vjs.zencdn.net/5.0/video-js.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="//vjs.zencdn.net/5.0/video.min.js"></script>
```

Then, whenever you want to use Video.js you can simply use the `<video>` element as your normally would, but with an additional `data-setup` attribute containing any Video.js options. These options
can include any Video.js option plus potential [plugin](http://videojs.com/plugins/) options, just make sure they're valid JSON!

```html
<video id="really-cool-video" class="video-js vjs-default-skin" controls
 preload="auto" width="640" height="264" poster="really-cool-video-poster.jpg"
 data-setup='{}'>
  <source src="really-cool-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="really-cool-video.webm" type="video/webm">
  <p class="vjs-no-js">
    To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser
    that <a href="http://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a>
  </p>
</video>
```

If you don't want to use auto-setup, you can leave off the `data-setup` attribute and initialize a video element manually.

```javascript
var player = videojs('really-cool-video', { /* Options */ }, function() {
  console.log('Good to go!');

  this.play(); // if you don't trust autoplay for some reason

  // How about an event listener?
  this.on('ended', function() {
    console.log('awww...over so soon?');
  });
});
```
