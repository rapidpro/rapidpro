Installation & Usage:
1. Refer to the (demo/index.html) or http://www.balupton.com/projects/jquery-history if the demo is not included.

1. Fix known issues if there are any.

Known Issues:
1. None. Yay!

Query Strings:

If you would like to have a QueryString in your hash and fetch the contents of it. So for example we have:
	http://localhost/page/#subpage?a=true&b=false

And we would like to extract b. Then we can do:
	var hashData = hash.queryStringToJSON();
	console.log(hashData); // {a:true,b:false}
	console.log(hashData.a); // true
	console.log(hashData.b); // false

But first, you will have to download the queryStringToJSON function from within here:
	http://github.com/balupton/jquery-sparkle/blob/master/scripts/resources/core.string.js

And place it within your own code.
It is not included within jQuery History by default, as it is not essential.
