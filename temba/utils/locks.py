    NonBlockingLock is a ContextManager for a Redis Lock that does not block when trying to acquire the lock. It also
    exposes the Lock within the ContextManager so it is possible to manipulate the lock directly and for example extend
    the duration of the lock with in context.

    Note:
        After requesting the lock, the first MUST call the `exit_if_not_locked()` method that will do the right thing
        and check if the lock was actually successfully acquired.

    Common usage pattern:

        with NonBlockingLock(redis=get_redis_connection(), name=lock_key, timeout=3600) as lock:
            lock.exit_if_not_locked()
            .
            .
            lock.extend(additional_time=600)
            .
            .
